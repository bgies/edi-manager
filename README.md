EDI Shack's EDI Manager repository is an Ionic 5 project which is the EDI Manager for the EDI-Javascript project. It is to be used in conjunction with the EDI Shack EDI-DB repository plus the EDI Shack EDI backend repository. Every EDI project consists of 2 essential services, tracking files and creating/reading EDI files. The EDI Shack philosophy is to give small and medium size companies the common EDI tools everyone can use.   

All of EDI Shack's EDI frameworks use this manager. The licence is MIT, so feel free to download it and use it however you want.  

 
## Status of the project
